# Level 3: Interaction Architecture

**Document Type:** HOW (Conceptual)
**References:** Levels 1-2 + External only

---

## Two Modes of Interaction

The exhibit serves two distinct actors with different interaction patterns:

| Actor | Primary Goal | Interaction Style |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Creator** | Document and organize creative work | Deliberate, reflective, ongoing |
| **Visitor** | Explore and find resonance | Wandering, curiosity-driven, episodic |

---

## Creator Interaction Patterns

### Adding Content

Content enters the exhibit through multiple paths:

**Path A: Fragment to Artifact**
1. Idea captured locally (private fragment)
2. Fragment develops over time
3. Creator reviews and decides readiness
4. Promoted to public artifact
5. Linked to relevant threads

**Path B: Direct Artifact**
1. Fully-formed work created
2. Creator reviews for public readiness
3. Added as artifact
4. Linked to relevant threads

**Path C: Thread Evolution**
1. New line of inquiry emerges
2. Thread created with description
3. Existing/new artifacts linked
4. Thread content evolves as inquiry develops

### Review Gate

Before content becomes public:
- Creator confirms readiness for outside eyes
- Content linked to at least one thread (maintains coherence)
- No quality judgment—only readiness judgment

**Supports:** Public/private boundary (L2), Authentic Documentation (L1)

### Maintenance Patterns

- **Linking**: Connecting artifacts to threads as relationships become clear
- **Updating**: Revising thread descriptions as understanding evolves
- **Archiving**: Marking work that no longer represents current practice (without deletion)

## Visitor Interaction Patterns

### Entry Points

Visitors arrive through multiple paths (no single "front door"):

| Entry | Typical Path | Next Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Search engine | Specific artifact | Discover context via threads |
| Direct link | Shared artifact | Explore related work |
| Curiosity | Charter/home | Browse threads or recent additions |
| Return visit | What's new | Check recent additions |

### Exploration Model

Navigation is **non-linear and self-directed**:

- No prescribed path through content
- Threads provide loose organization without hierarchy
- Visitors follow their curiosity
- Dead ends are acceptable (not every path connects)

**Supports:** Living Inquiry (L1), Exploration is the point (L2)

### Discovery Patterns

**Contextual Discovery**
- Artifact displays its thread connections
- Visitor can jump to thread to see related work
- Thread provides thematic context for individual pieces

**Thematic Browsing**
- Threads browsable as entry point
- Filter/view by medium (prose, code, music, etc.)
- No forced categorization—work can belong to multiple threads

**Temporal Awareness**
- "What's new" log shows recent additions
- Not a feed or timeline—just a changelog
- Supports return visitors without creating publishing pressure

---

## Interaction Scales

| Scale | Creator Experience | Visitor Experience |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Immediate** | Adding/editing content | Reading, viewing, listening |
| **Session** | Organizing, linking, reviewing | Exploring threads, following curiosity |
| **Extended** | Watching threads develop over time | Return visits, deepening familiarity |
| **Lifetime** | Body of work becoming coherent | Ongoing relationship with the work |

---

## System Coordination

### Content → Thread Relationship
- Artifacts belong to one or more threads
- Threads provide narrative context
- Charter frames the entire exhibit

### Visibility Flow
```
Private Fragments → [Review Gate] → Public Artifacts → Thread Links → Exhibit
```

### What's New Integration
- New artifacts automatically appear in changelog
- Thread updates optionally logged
- No notification system—pull only, no push

---

## Edge Cases and Failure Modes

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| Artifact fits no thread | Acceptable; can exist unlinked temporarily |
| Thread becomes stale | Remains visible; no pressure to update |
| Visitor finds nothing relevant | Expected; exhibit isn't for everyone |
| Creator stops updating | Exhibit remains as archive; no decay |
| Content needs revision | Update in place; changelog notes significant changes |

## Verification Criteria

Level 3 implementation is correct when:

- [ ] Creator can add content through multiple paths
- [ ] Review gate exists before content goes public
- [ ] Visitors can enter from any artifact and discover context
- [ ] Threads visibly connect related artifacts
- [ ] Exploration is possible without prescribed paths
- [ ] What's new log reflects recent additions
- [ ] Content can exist without thread links (flexibility)
- [ ] Exhibit remains functional if creator stops updating
