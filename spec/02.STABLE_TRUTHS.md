# Level 2: Stable Truths

**Document Type:** WHAT Strategy
**References:** Level 1 + External only

## Truth: Body of Work Over Individual Projects

The exhibit presents a holistic creative practice unified by theme, not a collection of discrete projects competing for attention. Individual works matter as part of the whole, not as standalone successes or failures.

**Supports:** Authentic Documentation, Living Inquiry (L1)

## Truth: Building in Public Without Performing

The work is visible but not performed. Sharing is an act of documentation, not marketing. The audience is incidental—welcome but never catered to.

**Supports:** Creator-first principle (L1)

## Truth: Success is Continuation, Not Capitalization

The exhibit succeeds when it remains a living part of the creative process. Failure is abandonment or returning to isolation. External metrics (visitors, engagement, monetization) are irrelevant to success.

**Supports:** No engagement optimization (L1)

## Truth: Organic Evolution Over Planned Structure

Structure emerges from use. The exhibit adapts to serve the creator's actual practice rather than conforming to predetermined templates or external expectations.

**Supports:** Authentic Documentation (L1)

## Truth: Ownership and Longevity Over Convenience

Technology choices prioritize creator control, simplicity, and durability. No platform dependencies that could disappear or change terms. The archive should outlast any particular service.

**Supports:** Creator-first principle (L1)

## Design Commitments

### The Exhibit Model

Borrowed framework organizing public creative work into layers:
- **Charter**: Public statement of values and intent
- **Threads**: Ongoing lines of inquiry that connect works across time
- **Artifacts**: Completed or shareable pieces

This model supports holistic presentation without requiring every piece to stand alone.

### Static-First Architecture

Content lives as files (markdown), not in databases or external services. The site generates from these files. This ensures:
- Content is portable and version-controlled
- No runtime dependencies on external services
- Longevity beyond any particular framework

### Public/Private Boundary

**Public (in exhibit):**
- Fully-formed thoughts ready for outside eyes
- Work that contributes to the visible body of work
- Charter, threads, artifacts

**Private (local only):**
- Passing or temporary ideas
- Ill-formed fragments still taking shape
- Work not yet ready to represent the practice

The boundary is about readiness, not quality judgment.

## Trade-offs Accepted

| Optimizing For | Accepting Trade-off |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Authenticity | May appear unpolished or incomplete |
| Simplicity | Fewer features than full CMS platforms |
| Ownership | More technical maintenance burden |
| Longevity | Less trendy/modern appearance |
| Creator coherence | May be harder for visitors to navigate |

## Rejected Approaches

### Traditional Portfolio
Rejects: Curated highlights, project-by-project presentation, success-oriented framing

### Social Media as Creative Home
Rejects: Platform dependency, algorithmic curation, engagement optimization, ephemeral presentation

### Blog Model
Rejects: Chronological organization, publishing cadence pressure, recency bias
