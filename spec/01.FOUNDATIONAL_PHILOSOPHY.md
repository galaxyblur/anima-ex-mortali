## Mission

Document and make visible a body of creative work unified by the theme of mortal angst—the existential anxiety that motivates human action. This exhibit exists primarily for the creator's coherence and documentation, while remaining publicly available for those who might find resonance, inspiration, or companionship in navigating their own mortality.

## Design Pillars

### 1. Authentic Documentation

The creator experiences coherence and witness; work is preserved as-is without pressure for polish or completion.

**Creator perspective:** "My work exists, is organized, and I can see the threads connecting it."

**Visitor perspective:** "I'm seeing real work, not a curated highlight reel."

### 2. Intimate Process

Visitors encounter genuine creative process—drafts, fragments, ongoing threads—not sanitized presentations.

**Creator perspective:** "I can share work-in-progress without anxiety about judgment."

**Visitor perspective:** "I feel invited into something real, not performed for me."

### 3. Existential Resonance

The work engages with mortality, meaning, and the mystery of existence—creating space for awe and for visitors to encounter their own angst.

**Creator perspective:** "My central theme is visible and taken seriously."

**Visitor perspective:** "This touches something I've felt but rarely see addressed directly."

### 4. Living Inquiry

Threads of exploration remain open and evolving. The exhibit is a working archive, not a finished monument.

**Creator perspective:** "I can follow ideas across time without forcing premature closure."

**Visitor perspective:** "I'm curious where these threads lead; I want to explore."

## Inviolable Principles

- **Creator-first**: This exists for the creator's documentation and coherence. Visitor experience is welcome but never optimized at the expense of authenticity.
- **No engagement optimization**: Never add features that chase metrics, notifications, or return visits.
- **Unpolished is acceptable**: Work at any stage of completion belongs here. Fragments have value.
- **Mortality stays central**: The theme of mortal angst is the organizing principle, not a marketing angle.

## Anti-Goals

- **Not a polished portfolio**: No pressure to present only finished, impressive work
- **Not a blog**: No publishing schedule, no expectation of regular updates
- **Not a teaching platform**: Ideas are shared, not packaged as lessons
- **Not engagement-driven**: No analytics anxiety, no growth hacking

## North Star

A living archive where creative work addressing mortal angst is documented, organized by threads of inquiry, and made visible—primarily for the creator's coherence, secondarily as an open invitation to anyone who encounters it and finds resonance.
