# Anima Ex Mortali

A living archive of creative work unified by mortal angst—the existential anxiety that motivates human action.

## What This Is

An exhibit, not a portfolio. Work at any stage of completion: finished albums, working prototypes, abandoned experiments, half-formed ideas. Organized by threads of inquiry rather than chronology or medium.

## Threads

- **Human Communication & Connection** — how we reach each other
- **Capoeira** — the Afro-Brazilian art form
- **Dissent & Complicity** — living with and in spite of political realities
- **Frameworks & Systems** — meta-tools for organizing creative chaos
- **Play** — interactive experiences and game mechanics
- **Inspiration** — seeds and sparks
