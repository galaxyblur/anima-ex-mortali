# Anima Ex Mortali

An exhibition of my creative work.

## Specification

Learn about how the spec should be written and maintained:

- `spec/00.SPEC_FRAMEWORK.md` (Copied from the `rootspec` package)

Before implementing, read the spec files in order:

1. `spec/01.FOUNDATIONAL_PHILOSOPHY.md` Why this project exists, design pillars
2. `spec/02.STABLE_TRUTHS.md` Strategic commitments, trade-offs
3. `spec/03.INTERACTION_ARCHITECTURE.md` User journeys, interaction patterns
4. `spec/04.SYSTEMS/` System designs (start with `SYSTEMS_OVERVIEW.md`)
5. `spec/05.IMPLEMENTATION/` User stories and tuning parameters
6. `spec/TECH.md` Tech stack, database schema, AI prompts, deployment

When asked to make changes, use a spec-driven development approach, where the spec must be updated before the implementation changes.
