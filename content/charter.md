# Anima Ex Mortali

*Soul from mortality*

A living exhibit of creative work unified by the theme of mortal angst—the existential anxiety that motivates human action.

## Mission

Document and make visible a body of creative work addressing mortality, meaning, and the navigation of existence. This exhibit exists for coherence and documentation, while remaining open to those who might find resonance.

## Values

- **Authenticity over polish** — Raw work has value. Unfinished is acceptable.
- **Process over product** — The journey matters. Threads stay open.
- **Body of work over individual projects** — The whole is the point, not any single piece.
- **Connection over isolation** — Ideas exist in relation. Work is made visible.

## What This Is

A working archive spanning code, prose, poetry, and music—all circling the same existential questions. Projects here range from practical tools to artistic meditations, connected by threads of inquiry.

## What This Is Not

- Not a polished portfolio
- Not a blog with a publishing schedule
- Not a teaching platform
- Not optimized for engagement
