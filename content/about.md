My name is Corky Brown. I make things—software, music, poems, games. I've been doing this long enough that the pile of unfinished work behind me has started to look less like failure and more like a pattern. Everything I make is circling the same question.

At some point, the awareness of time running out stopped being abstract. It becomes real in different ways for different people: something ends, something you built quietly disappears, you look up and realize how much has already passed. For me the anxiety didn't arrive as crisis—it arrived as urgency. A pressure to account for what I was actually doing here, what I was actually making.

I spent years treating the scatter as a problem. The jumping between projects, the half-finished songs and abandoned prototypes, the code sitting in private repositories nobody would ever see. I kept waiting to find the one thing I was supposed to be doing. The thing that would justify the time.

This exhibit is what I made when I stopped waiting. The theme—mortal angst, the existential awareness that motivates human action—turned out to be the connective tissue I'd been missing. The music and the software and the poems aren't different projects. They're different attempts at the same conversation.

I built this for myself, mostly. To see the shape of what I've been making all along. But I put it in public because some conversations need a witness.
