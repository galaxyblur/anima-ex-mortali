falling for the love narcotic
fourteen times and failed quixotic
lonely attic, trapped, with static
thoughts erasing sought resolve

and thus is all the trust i've left
now thrust sub-deck on sails sent west
red-orange sets said star, since soon
such brilliance sits now whence the moon

reflecting truth to cool my skin, he
blooms these lunacies within me
taking ruth to tame above,
so taunts the ticking second-hand of love

as seen from Earth across a void
so vast, vicarious light does cast
a shadow doomed to follow, joy
is cursed with darkness, looming past


destroyed my heart, she did
the final piece of love,
she rid me of
