A virtual gift for my wife on our tenth anniversary. Depicts our first date as a retro point-and-click adventure game.

## Origin

December 2nd, 2015 was the day we met. Ten years later, I wanted to give her something that would last—a memory transformed into something she could revisit, explore, and play.

## Connection to SpriteStory

Building this sparked the idea for [SpriteStory](/artifacts/spritestory). If I could make this for us, others might want to create similar experiences for the people they love.
