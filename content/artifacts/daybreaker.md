A passion project born from the COVID-19 pandemic. An app that helps users manage their time, balance their workload, track tasks, and feel better about the things they're doing.

## Approach

Uses elements of game design and behavior science to help users:
- Stay focused on their goals
- Get done what they want to get done
- Stay balanced and mentally healthy
- Feel good

## Theme

The visual metaphor of a solar eclipse guides the user towards a peaceful, resolved state at the end of their day.

## Status

On hiatus while other projects take priority, but will always be in development. Some projects are never finished—they evolve alongside you.
