A short story set on an island ruled by rigid class hierarchy. Baba Overhill—who rose from bullied "Sandeater" orphan to tyrannical market lord—is poisoned by the very youth workers he exploited. The town's Investigator uncovers the truth too late, killed by the uprising before he can warn anyone.

The story moves between timeframes: Baba's death during a storm, his cruel past interactions with Sera (a gifted hand-youth), his origin as an abused child taken in by the original Mr. Overhill, and the Investigator's doomed pursuit of justice. Through coded messages and stolen bikes, the oppressed youth orchestrate revolution from below.

Themes include the cycle of abuse, complicity in oppressive systems, xenophobia and scapegoating, and the corrupting nature of power.
