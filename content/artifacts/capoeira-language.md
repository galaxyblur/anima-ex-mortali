An exploration of capoeira—the Afro-Brazilian martial art and dance form—through a linguistic framework. Can its movements be documented and studied like a language?

## The Project

Developing a custom writing system to represent capoeira movements in two-dimensional form. The symbols are abstract rather than literal depictions of physical configurations, similar to how the International Phonetic Alphabet represents sounds without picturing mouths.

## Why It Matters

Capoeira is traditionally passed down through embodied practice, observation, and oral tradition. A writing system offers new ways to analyze, preserve, and communicate the art form's vocabulary of movement.
