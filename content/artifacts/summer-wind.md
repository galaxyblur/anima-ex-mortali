I am fleeting like the summer wind
Coming where the scene begins
Falling 'cross the floor, we steal
shadows in the light we feel.

In my twin a thought reflected, yet
instead she sought the unexpected
The moments fought just seconds past
mind not my breath that's fleeting fast

In every spin a weight rescinds,
is cast away from deep within


I am fleeting like the summer wind;
we come from where the scene begins
Falling 'cross the floor; reveal
shadows in the light we steal

In every spin a weight rescinds,
is cast away from deep within
And voices wash me o'er to feel
Like stones upon a river wheel

My twin reflects a thought in dance
Yet saw ahead my best advance
The moments fought just seconds past
mind not my breath that's fleeting fast
