Simple flower, sound the hour
slow to let the light devour
Blossom, bloom, and show me,
petals
fold unto the void below thee
Timid colors, pink or violet,
red sometimes in blushing silence
Nature be thy pilot -- I would
love to guide a waking eyelid

 
Through the harsh environment;
a many-seasoned sire sent
to sweep and shear from shires spent,
whence forth to thy retirement
A life reborn in pleasant sun
and gentle rain of breezes run,
skimmed o'er the rivers, seizing such
that flowers never want for much

 
To touch your length with care, and slide
around the thorns on every side
to lead my loving hands, and cup
my palm, and lift your spirit up
Soaking in your scent, a floral
circumventing breath, unspent,
inhaled and subsequently heated
hurries to a heart unseated
