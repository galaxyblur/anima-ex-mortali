Coming to a clearing from the trees,
  the winds are commandeering seas
  of green and gold, the swaying fleece
  of Earth, revealed at freedom's berth
I watch the wind, it whips the wheat
  in ripples racing through the heat
  and spaced so evenly across
  the wings of heaven's albatross

Awaken from the trees, to clearing;
  seas of gold and green revealing
Swaying fleece of Earth, I see
  at freedom's berth, endearing me
A windy ripple wave repeating
  across the sunlight, soothing wheat
Upon my ear a whistle, fleeting,
  upon my skin a UV heat

To unmake dreams that thrive in shade,
  the sun dismantles my cascade
From canopy to castle court,
  encircled by the wooden fort

Leaning in and falling forward
Feet propel the torso toward

With every step, the pace,
recalling tears across a crying face,
accelerates into a flight
with arms outstretched to span the light
that's cast upon a thriving land,
as tips of grain meet greeting hands
A chilling breath upon the back,
a final burst from forests, black

The sunlight cuts through atmosphere,
like courage overtaking fear,
our runner may just disappear
into the woodland drawing near
