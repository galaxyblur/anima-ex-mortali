## Premise

The Edvari people have built their civilization around the Mouth — a black obelisk, 40 meters tall, of a material no one can scratch or chip. Every 17 hours, it hums to life: lights ripple across its surface in patterns that feel almost linguistic, and a voice speaks in a tonal, rhythmic language no living person understands. Scholars call these utterances *the Litany*. After exactly 5 hours, silence returns.

## The Society

The Edvari don't worship the Mouth — they *schedule* around it. Markets open after the Litany ends. Births are timed to it. The calendar's smallest unit is the 17-hour cycle. There are priests, but their job is interpretation, not supplication. Every generation, a new interpretation rises: prophecy, weather prediction, moral instruction, a record of the dead. None of them are right.

## The Truth

Ten thousand years ago, the Edvari's ancestors launched a monitoring satellite — a routine geophysical survey drone, hardened for longevity. The Mouth is a ground relay station. When the satellite passes overhead, it downlinks collected data: seismic readings, atmospheric composition, orbital telemetry. The 5-hour window is the contact arc. The "unknown language" is a compressed binary data format over a now-obsolete radio protocol.

The civilization that built it collapsed. The satellite does not know this. It has been faithfully reporting to no one for 10,000 years.

## The Protagonist

A disgraced linguist — stripped of her position after publishing a heretical paper arguing the Litany has no semantic content, only structure — discovers a corroded metal plate buried at the Mouth's base. It's an instruction panel. She can't read it, but she recognizes it as *manufactured*. Not divine. Not alien.

*Made.*

---

## Central Tension

Her discovery doesn't threaten faith — it threatens *identity*. If the Mouth is a machine, then the Edvari are not chosen people orbiting a mystery. They are the amnesiac descendants of engineers, camping in the shadow of their own forgotten infrastructure.

The question isn't whether to reveal the truth. It's: **what do you do when your sacred monument is a voicemail no one will ever check?**

## Themes

- The archaeology of self — civilizations as layers of forgotten selves
- The sacredness of function vs. meaning
- What we inherit vs. what we invent about our past
- The loneliness of continuity (the satellite, still working, still alone)

## Tone

Quiet science fiction. More Le Guin than Clarke. The satellite never appears as a character, but its perspective could bookend chapters — clinical, faithful, unaware of the world it shaped.
