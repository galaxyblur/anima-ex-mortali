An AI-powered tool that generates personalized interactive pixel art point-and-click stories.

## Origin

- Pixel art visuals generated per scene
- Play as point-and-click adventure
- Share with loved ones

## Connection to Mortality

At its core, SpriteStory is about capturing moments before they fade. A tool for translating ephemeral memories into artifacts that persist. The pixel art aesthetic—deliberately lo-fi, nostalgic—acknowledges that memory itself is compressed, stylized, imperfect.

Making something playable from a memory is an act against forgetting.
